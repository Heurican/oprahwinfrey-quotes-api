#### You get a car! You get a car! YOU ALL GET CARS!

This is an API made for Oprah Winfrey quotes. With 20 quotes of quality Oprah Winfrey, this API is the perfect solution for smaller-scale (or larger scale!) discord bot
developers, web app creators, and just people like me, only interested in messing around. You can see all the quotes in quotes.json in the repo.

#### See an issue?

Feel free to file an issue and I'll get right on it.

#### Have a quote to add?

Feel free to add your own quotes. Try to keep everything you put in there family-friendly (if Oprah ever even said anything NSFW? whatever). Just follow the normal indentation and
make a new line (with proper indentation as mentioned before) and add 
<br>
```{"quote": "add whatever quote you want here- no need to mention that oprah said it because guess what"}```

The Red line marks the proper indentation to line up with, and the Blue help note the proper punctuation to use.


## And that's it!
